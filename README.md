# Housing Price Prediction Web App

Website URL: https://housing-prediction-web-app.herokuapp.com/

Based off the housing and U.S. census dataset from [wlifferth's GitHub repo](https://github.com/wlifferth/build-an-ml-web-app). When the user fills out the information on the form, a housing price prediction is made. The model for this prediction was constructed using XGBoost. Details for this model can be found in my [Google Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1HqXrIcoCs4K612R8kIiMpNa5MYb0hKpP?usp=sharing).
