Based off the housing and U.S. census dataset from [wlifferth's GitHub repo](https://github.com/wlifferth/build-an-ml-web-app). When the user fills out the information on the form, a housing price prediction is made. The model for this prediction was constructed using XGBoost. Details for this model can be found in my_model.ipynb.
